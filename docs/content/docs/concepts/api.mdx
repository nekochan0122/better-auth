description: Better Auth API
---

When you create a new Better Auth instance, it gives you an `api` object. This object provides functions to interact with the server while your code is running server-side.

Any endpoint added to Better Auth, whether from plugins or the core, will be accessible through the `api` object.

## Calling API on the Server

To call an API endpoint on the server, import your `auth` instance and call the endpoint using the `api` object.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { headers } from "next/server";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        // add your plugins here
    ]
})

// calling get session on the server
await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: headers()
})
```

Unlike the client, the server needs the values to be passed as an object with the key `body` for the body, `headers` for the headers, and `query` for the query.

Better Auth uses a library called [better-call](https://github.com/bekacru/better-call) to create API endpoints. Developed by the same team, it's built to integrate seamlessly with Better Auth. With Better Call, you can invoke `rest` API handlers as if they were regular functions.

### Getting the `Response` Object

When you invoke an API endpoint on the server, it will return a standard JavaScript object or array directly. To get the `Response` object instead, you can use the `asResponse` option.

```ts title="server.ts"
const response = await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email: "",
        password: ""
    },
    asResponse: true
})
```

## Error Handling

When you call an API endpoint in the server, it will throw an error if the request fails. You can catch the error and handle it as you see fit. The error instance is an instance of `APIError`.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

try {
    await auth.api.signInEmail({
        body: {
            email: "",
            password: ""
        }
    })
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof APIError) {
        console.log(error.message, error.status)
    }
}
```
