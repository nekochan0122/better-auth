description: Learn how cookies are used in BetterAuth
---

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, CSRF tokens, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

Core Better Auth cookies like `session` and `csrf` will follow `betterauth.${cookie_name}` format.

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` if the server is running in production mode.

### Cross Subdomain Cookies (ðŸ§ª Expiremental)

By default, cookies are not shared between subdomains. However, if you need to access the same session across different subdomains, you can enable cross-subdomain cookies. To do this, set `crossSubDomainCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

Keep in mind that this does not imply that all cookies will be shared across subdomains; only a specific subset of cookies necessary for session sharing will be set.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: "example.com" // Optional. Defaults to the base url domain
        }
    }
})
```

### Disable CSRF Cookie (âš ï¸Ž Not Recommended)

If you want to disable the CSRF cookie, you can set `disableCsrfCheck` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        disableCsrfCheck: true
    }
})
```

### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure if the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```

## CSRF Protection

Better Auth uses multiple ways to protect your app from cross-site request forgery attacks. First better auth cookies are marked as `HttpOnly` and `Secure` by default. This makes them inaccessible to client-side scripts and ensures that they can only be sent over HTTPS. And all cookies use the `SameSite=Lax` attribute by default. Which prevents them from being sent on a cross-site request. 

Second, Better Auth uses CSRF tokens. By default, CSRF token check is disabled for the same origin as `baseURL`. For other origins, whenever a `POST` request is made, the CSRF token check is enforced.

You can change this behavior using the `disableCSRFTokenCheck` option on the client. 

Once you set `disableCSRFTokenCheck` to `true`, CSRF token check is completely disabled for the client making the request. Now if a request comes from an untrusted origin, it will fail with a `403` error. To allow requests from untrusted origins, you can specify the list of origins in `trustedOrigins` option on the server. All origins specified in `trustedOrigins` are excluded from CSRF token check.

You can also disable CSRF token check for all clients by setting `advanced.disableCSRFCheck` option on the server. You should only do this if your framework handles CSRF protection itself.
